//! Timer heap — ported from `runtime/time.go`.
//!
//! ## Design — sharded min-heaps
//!
//! Go's runtime uses per-P 4-ary min-heaps for timers.  We approximate that
//! with a fixed array of [`TIMER_SHARDS`] independent min-heaps, each behind
//! its own `Mutex` and fronted by an `AtomicU64` caching that shard's
//! earliest deadline.  A goroutine's `sleep` inserts into the shard selected
//! by its current `P`'s id, so sleepers on different Ps do not contend on a
//! single lock; the old single global heap serialised every `sleep` and the
//! timer thread on one mutex.
//!
//! A fixed shard array (rather than a literally per-P heap) sidesteps the
//! `allp`-can-grow / `GOMAXPROCS`-resize problem: the timer thread iterates a
//! compile-time-constant set of shards with no dependency on the scheduler's
//! P list, reading each shard's `earliest` atomic locklessly to skip empty or
//! not-yet-due shards without taking its lock.  Shard choice never affects
//! correctness — every entry is found by a full all-shard scan — so a
//! goroutine migrating between selecting a shard and locking it is harmless,
//! requiring no preemption pin.
//!
//! ## Execution model
//!
//! A dedicated OS timer thread (`timer_thread`) sleeps with
//! `thread::park_timeout` until the earliest deadline across all shards.  It
//! then, for each shard whose `earliest ≤ now`:
//! 1. Pops all timers whose `when ≤ now` from that shard's heap.
//! 2. Calls `goready` on each parked G.
//!
//! When `sleep` adds a timer earlier than its shard's previous earliest, it
//! calls `thread::unpark` on the timer thread to shorten its sleep.
//!
//! ## Relationship with sysmon
//!
//! The timer thread is completely independent from `sysmon`; `sysmon` handles
//! CPU preemption and P-retake, while the timer thread handles only sleeping
//! goroutines.
