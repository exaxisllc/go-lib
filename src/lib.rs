//! # go-lib
//!
//! Go-style concurrency for Rust: goroutines, channels, `select`, `WaitGroup` —
//! built on a port of the M:N scheduler from <https://github.com/golang/go>.
//!
//! No async runtime is used: the scheduler, channels, and parking primitives
//! are ported from `src/runtime/` in the Go repo. Mutexes and read-write locks
//! are taken straight from [`std::sync`] because their uncontended path is
//! just an atomic CAS — porting Go's versions would be code without benefit.
//! See [`runtime::syscall`] for the shim that keeps `std` blocking calls
//! scheduler-safe.
//!
//! ## Public surface
//! - `#[go_lib::main]` — entry-point attribute; runs the body as the program's
//!   first goroutine on the process-wide scheduler (replaces the old `run`)
//! - `go!` / `select!` macros — spawn goroutines, multiplex channel ops
//! - [`chan`] — buffered and unbuffered channels
//! - [`net`] — goroutine-aware `TcpListener` / `TcpStream` *(v0.2.0)*
//! - [`scope`] / [`scope::Scope`] — scoped goroutines with safe short-lived borrows
//! - [`sync::WaitGroup`] — wait for a collection of goroutines
//! - [`sync::Cond`] — goroutine-aware condition variable
//! - [`sync::Mutex`] / [`sync::RwLock`] — re-exports of `std::sync`
//! - [`context`] — cancellation and deadline propagation
//! - [`set_panic_handler`] — customise goroutine-panic behaviour
//! - [`set_gomaxprocs`] / [`gomaxprocs`] — runtime parallelism control
//!
//! ## Internals
//! See [`runtime`] for the scheduler (G/M/P, parking, work stealing, sysmon,
//! stack growth, async preemption, netpoll).
//!
//! ## v0.4.0 — new in this release
//!
//! - **`scope` / `ScopedJoinHandle`**: scoped goroutines with safe short-lived
//!   borrows, mirroring `std::thread::scope`.  Goroutines spawned inside a
//!   `scope` closure can borrow data from the enclosing stack frame; the
//!   scheduler guarantees every spawned goroutine finishes before `scope`
//!   returns.  `ScopedJoinHandle::join()` returns `std::thread::Result<R>` so
//!   goroutine panics surface as `Err` rather than aborting the process.
//! - **Channel double-free fix**: the blocking-receive resume path in
//!   `chanrecv` used `ptr::read` followed by `Box::from_raw` on the same
//!   allocation, which double-dropped the inner value and caused use-after-free
//!   when the moved-out value was later inspected (e.g. a panic payload passed
//!   through a scoped join handle).  Fixed by casting the `Box` to
//!   `ManuallyDrop<Option<T>>` before dropping, so only the heap allocation is
//!   freed without re-running the destructor.
//!
//! ## v0.3.1 — new in this release
//!
//! - **G state machine**: `casgstatus` centralises all goroutine status
//!   transitions.  `GSYSCALL`, `GCOPYSTACK`, `GPREEMPTED`, and `GSCAN` are
//!   now wired into `entersyscall`/`exitsyscall`, `copystack`, and `preemptm`
//!   respectively, matching Go 1.14+ semantics.
//! - **`systemstack`**: runs a closure on the M's g0 (system) stack via a
//!   naked-assembly RSP/SP switch.  Implemented for both AMD64 (SysV + Windows
//!   x64) and AArch64 (AAPCS64).
//!
//! ## v0.2.0 — new in this release
//!
//! - **Dynamic stack growth** (Step 3): goroutines start with a 64 KiB stack
//!   and grow automatically up to 1 GiB via SIGSEGV guard-page detection and
//!   `copystack` (conservative pointer adjustment).
//! - **Async preemption** (Step 4): sysmon sends `SIGURG` to the M thread whose
//!   goroutine has run > 10 ms.  The signal handler redirects execution to an
//!   assembly trampoline that saves all registers, calls `async_preempt2`, and
//!   restores state on resume — a transparent, non-cooperative yield.
//! - **Netpoll / async I/O** (Step 5): `epoll` on Linux, `kqueue` on macOS,
//!   IOCP on Windows.  Goroutines park on blocking I/O and are re-enqueued
//!   when the operation is ready (Unix) or completes (Windows IOCP).
//!   See the [`net`] module for `TcpListener` / `TcpStream`.
//!
//! ## Known limitations
//!
//! ### `defer` / `recover` / cross-goroutine `panic`
//! Goroutine panics are caught and routed to [`set_panic_handler`]; the
//! process does not abort.  Go's `recover()` (stopping panic propagation at a
//! call-stack boundary) has no direct Rust equivalent — use `catch_unwind`
//! inside the goroutine body when fine-grained recovery is needed.
//!
//! ### Race detector
//! The Go race detector is a compiler/runtime feature with no Rust equivalent
//! in this crate.  Use `cargo test --cfg loom` with the [loom model checker]
//! for systematic concurrency testing.
//!
//! ## Unsafe conventions
//! The runtime modules (`src/runtime/`) are a direct port of Go's C-adjacent
//! runtime code.  Almost every function is `unsafe fn` because it operates on
//! raw goroutine pointers and `mmap`'d memory.  Inner `unsafe {}` blocks are
//! omitted for brevity (suppressed via `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn`) — the caller's
//! obligation is documented in each function's `# Safety` section instead.
#![deny(missing_docs)]
// The runtime is a deliberate port of Go's low-level C-adjacent scheduler code.
// Virtually every function is `unsafe fn`; requiring inner `unsafe {}` blocks
// on every raw-pointer dereference would add noise without safety information.
// Each `unsafe fn`'s contract is documented in its `# Safety` section instead.
#![allow(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]

// Let the crate refer to itself as `go_lib` so the `#[go_lib::main]` attribute
// macro — which expands to `go_lib::__main_entry(…)` — works in this crate's
// own unit tests, doctests, and examples without a special in-crate spelling.
